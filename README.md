- TASK OPTION 2: COMPARING SORTING ALGORITHMS

(1)	Implement three sorting algorithms as described in the slide week 9 in C++
(2)	Test each algorithm on the random input of different size, e.g. 10, 100, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000, 100000, 5000000, 1000000. Please read the Slide “How to generate random arrays”, available at Binus Maya Session 17 or in Schoology Week 9, to know the programming technique to generate random arrays
(3)	Record the running time of each input size. Please read the Slide “How to measure runtime in C++”, available at Binus Maya Session 17 or in Schoology Week 9, to know the programming technique to measure runtime.
(4)	Plot the results of your measurement of three sorting algorithm on the same chart. An example of the charts is depicted below:
(5)	Based on the chart, which of the three algorithm is the fastest/slowest?
(6)	Identify the complexity of each algorithm and discuss if the chart resembles the complexity function.
